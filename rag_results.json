The base model has 6 attention heads, a model dimension (dmodel) of 512, a feed-forward network dimension (dff) of 2048, and an embedding dimension (dk) of 64.\n2. The model was evaluated on English-to-German translation on the newstest2013 development set.\n3. The performance metrics used are perplexity (PPL) and BLEU score.\n4. The model variations include changes to the number of attention heads, attention key and value dimensions, model size, and dropout rate.\n5. The results show that:\n\t* Single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting.\n\t* Reducing the attention key size hurts model quality.\n\t* Bigger models are better.\n\t* Dropout is helpful in avoiding over-fitting.\n\t* Replacing sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings results in nearly identical performance.\n\n**Visual Patterns:**\n\n1. **Table Structure:** The table has 13 columns and 15 rows, including the header row.\n2. **Column Names:**\n\t* N (number of attention heads)\n\t* dmodel (model dimension)\n\t* dff (feed-forward network dimension)\n\t* h (number of heads)\n\t* dk (embedding dimension)\n\t* dv (value dimension)\n\t* Pdrop (dropout rate)\n\t* ϵls (label smoothing)\n\t* train steps (number of training steps)\n\t* PPL (perplexity)\n\t* BLEU (BLEU score)\n\t* params (number of parameters)\n3. **Row Patterns:**\n\t* The base model is listed on the first row.\n\t* Model variations are grouped into sections (A) to (E).\n\t* Each section represents a specific type of model variation.\n4. **Data Types:**\n\t* Integer values (e.g., 6, 512, 2048)\n\t* Floating-point values (e.g., 0.1, 0.9)\n\t* Categorical values (e.g., \"positional embedding instead of sinusoids\")\n\n**Searchable Index:**\n\nTo create a searchable index, you can use the following keywords and phrases:\n\n* Model variations\n* Attention heads\n* Model dimension\n* Feed-forward network dimension\n* Embedding dimension\n* Dropout rate\n* Perplexity\n* BLEU score\n* English-to-German translation\n* newstest2013 development set\n* Transformer architecture\n\nYou can also use specific values and ranges to search for specific data points, such as:\n\n* \"6 attention heads\"\n* \"512 model dimension\"\n* \"2048 feed-forward network dimension\"\n* \"0.1 dropout rate\"\n* \"25.8 BLEU score\"\n\nThis searchable index can help you quickly locate specific information within the text and table.",

In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of Pdrop = 0.1.\n\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.",
