The training cost was only 3.5 days on 8 P100s.\\nJakob: We should also mention the constituency parsing results. It proves the Transformer generalizes well to structural tasks with limited data.\\nNoam: Agreed. The 4-layer Transformer we trained on WSJ data got 91.3 F1, which is impressive for a model not specifically tuned for parsing.\\nAshish: Finally, we need to clarify the positional encoding. We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to longer sequences.\"),\n",

We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\n\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/ tensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\n\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.'),\n",

      "Niki worked on the English-to-German experiments [transformer_meeting@00:01:50.500]. The detailed results of the work are as follows: The big Transformer model achieved a BLEU score of 28.4, outperforming the best previously reported models, including ensembles, by more than 2.0 BLEU. This establishes a new state-of-the-art BLEU score. The base model also performed well, beating the previous SOTA ensembles with a BLEU score of 27.3. The training cost for the big model was 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs [attention-is-all-you-need(p.8), transformer_meeting@00:01:50.500].\n",

The results are summarized in Table 2, which compares the translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature [attention-is-all-you-need(p.8)]. \n",

      "The meeting discussed several aspects of the transformer model, including its performance on various tasks and its architecture. The discussion began with Niki sharing the results of English-to-German experiments, where the big model achieved 28.4 BLEU and the base model achieved 27.3 BLEU, beating previous state-of-the-art ensembles [transformer_meeting@00:01:50.500, transformer_meeting@00:01:15.200]. \n",
      "\n",
      "The group also discussed the English-to-French score, which reached 41.8 BLEU with a training cost of only 3.5 days on 8 P100s [transformer_meeting@00:01:50.500, transformer_meeting@00:01:15.200]. Additionally, they touched on the constituency parsing results, where a 4-layer Transformer trained on WSJ data achieved 91.3 F1, which is impressive for a model not specifically tuned for parsing [transformer_meeting@00:01:50.500, transformer_meeting@00:02:32.100].\n",
      "\n",
      "The architecture of the transformer model was also discussed, including the encoder layer, which consists of two sub-layers: multi-head self-attention and a position-wise feed-forward network, along with residual connections and layer normalization [transformer_meeting@00:01:15.200]. The group decided on the sinusoidal version of positional encoding, which may allow the model to extrapolate to longer sequences [transformer_meeting@00:01:50.500, transformer_meeting@00:02:32.100].\n",

      "The Transformer architecture is based on an encoder-decoder structure, which maps an input sequence of symbol representations to a sequence of continuous representations, and then generates an output sequence of symbols one element at a time [attention-is-all-you-need(p.2)]. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Transformer model consists of stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder. The encoder takes in a sequence of symbol representations and outputs a sequence of continuous representations. The decoder then generates an output sequence of symbols, one element at a time, consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input [attention-is-all-you-need(p.2)].\n",
      "\n",
      "The Transformer architecture relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, allowing for significantly more parallelization. This is in contrast to recurrent neural networks, which have a sequential nature that precludes parallelization within training examples [attention-is-all-you-need(p.2)].\n",
      "\n",
      "The Transformer model uses multi-head attention, which relates different positions of a single sequence to compute a representation of the sequence. This allows the model to learn dependencies between distant positions more effectively [attention-is-all-you-need(p.2)].\n",
      "\n",
      "The architecture of the Transformer model is shown in the figure, which includes the encoder and decoder components, with their respective layers and attention mechanisms.\n",
