The encoder maps input $x$ to continuous representations $z$, then the decoder generates output $y$ auto-regressively.\\nJakob: I think we should emphasize that each encoder layer has two sub-layers: multi-head self-attention and a position-wise feed-forward network.\\nAshish: Plus the residual connections around each sub-layer followed by layer normalization. We need that $LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x))$ formula in the doc.\\nNoam: Don't forget the dimensionality. All sub-layers and embedding layers produce outputs of dimension 512. It keeps the residuals consistent.\\nNiki: I've finished the English-to-German experiments. The big model hit 28.4 BLEU. Even the base model at 27.3 BLEU beats the previous SOTA ensembles.\\nIllia: That’s incredible. And the English-to-French score? I saw we reached 41.8 BLEU. The training cost was only 3.5 days on 8 P100s.\\nJakob: We should also mention the constituency parsing results. It proves the Transformer generalizes well to structural tasks with limited data.\\nNoam: Agreed. The 4-layer Transformer we trained on WSJ data got 91.3 F1, which is impressive for a model not specifically tuned for parsing.\")]"

    "\n",
    "This unified query pipeline provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Unified Querying**: Query both documents and transcripts together  \n",
    "✅ **Source-Aware Citations**: Different citation formats for documents vs transcripts  \n",
    "✅ **Document Citations**: `[doc_name(p.X)]` with page numbers and positions  \n",
    "✅ **Transcript Citations**: `[meeting_name@timestamp]` with meeting metadata  \n",
    "✅ **Mixed Results**: AI can combine information from both sources  \n",
    "✅ **Filtering Options**: Query all sources or filter by type  \n",
    "✅ **Vision Support**: Process images from document chunks  \n",
    "✅ **Export Results**: Save answers and citations to JSON  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Citation Formats:**\n",
    "- **Documents**: `[attention-is-all-you-need(p.3, p.5)]`\n",
    "- **Transcripts**: `[Project Kickoff Meeting@00:15:30]`\n",
    "- **Mixed**: `[attention-is-all-you-need(p.3), Project Kickoff Meeting@00:15:30]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "1. Update `PROJECT_NAME` to match your ingestion pipelines\n",
    "2. Modify `QUERY` to ask your questions\n",
    "3. Run the pipeline to get answers with mixed sources\n",
    "4. Export results for further analysis"
