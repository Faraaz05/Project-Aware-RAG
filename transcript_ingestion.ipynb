    "This notebook provides a complete transcript ingestion pipeline:\n",

    "✅ **Same Embedding Model**: Uses Google Gemini (same as document pipeline)  \n",
    "✅ **Unified Database**: Stores in `unified_chroma_db` alongside documents  \n",
    "✅ **Project Collections**: Uses `project_{name}` collections for organization  \n",
    "✅ **Speaker-Turn Chunking**: Intelligent chunking with overlap  \n",
    "✅ **Rich Metadata**: Tracks meetings, speakers, timestamps  \n",
    "✅ **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple transcripts efficiently  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "1. Update `VTT_FILE_PATH` to your actual transcript file\n",
    "2. Run the ingestion\n",
    "3. Query both documents and transcripts together using your existing RAG pipeline"
