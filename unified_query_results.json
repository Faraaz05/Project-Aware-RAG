The encoder maps input $x$ to continuous representations $z$, then the decoder generates output $y$ auto-regressively.\nJakob: I think we should emphasize that each encoder layer has two sub-layers: multi-head self-attention and a position-wise feed-forward network.\nAshish: Plus the residual connections around each sub-layer followed by layer normalization. We need that $LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x))$ formula in the doc.\nNoam: Don't forget the dimensionality. All sub-layers and embedding layers produce outputs of dimension 512. It keeps the residuals consistent.\nNiki: I've finished the English-to-German experiments. The big model hit 28.4 BLEU. Even the base model at 27.3 BLEU beats the previous SOTA ensembles.\nIllia: That’s incredible. And the English-to-French score? I saw we reached 41.8 BLEU. The training cost was only 3.5 days on 8 P100s.\nJakob: We should also mention the constituency parsing results. It proves the Transformer generalizes well to structural tasks with limited data.\nNoam: Agreed. The 4-layer Transformer we trained on WSJ data got 91.3 F1, which is impressive for a model not specifically tuned for parsing.",
